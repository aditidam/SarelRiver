<p> "River is a native of Haifa, Israel, has gigged in Budapest, eventually relocating in New York where he has become active on the local jazz circuit. The not oft heard combination of guitar and flute creates a different but pleasant aural sensation, having an echo chamber effect on some cuts." -  Dave Nathan, All Music Guide </p>



<p> "Love at first sight often involves another person or even an object. But for jazz guitarist and composer, Sarel River, Cupidâ€™s fateful arrow struck the very first time he heard jazz."  - Lucy Banduci, Queens Chronicle </p>

<p> Here is a new CD by SAREL RIVER that gives you some excellent instrument tracks nicely done with
guitar, bass and flute. Sarel is not only a supberb guitarist but he is a composer, also. Sarel's music is stimulating and inviting. He has a flair for mixing instrumentation that adds to the enjoyment of listening to this superb CD over and over again.
 - Jim Stone, WLNZ, 89.7 FM </p>
 
 <p> I enjoyed very much this marvelous recording by this brilliant young composer-guitarist Sarel River. It's nice to know that his career started here in Boston where he attended The Berklee College of Music. Sarel's music will continue to captivate listeners for many years to come. This is a wonderful debut for a multi-talented musician who deserves to be heard by all those who appreciate great jazz.

  - Ron Della Chiesa, WGBH/WPCM - Boston, MA </p>
