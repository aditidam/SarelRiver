<p> The recent release of Long Ride Back, his third recording as a leader, is the latest milestone in Sarel River’s career. A superb jazz guitarist with his own sound and creative style, Sarel has been a major part of the New York music scene for the past 20 years, and he has continued to grow and evolve with each passing year.
 </p>
</div> 




<div class="p1"> 
<p> Sarel River was born in Haifa, Israel, originally being trained as a classical violinist. “I grew up in a classical music environment, often playing Mozart,” he remembers. While he always loved classical, early on Sarel began to listen with great interest to other styles of music, including the pop songs that he heard on the radio. He became a serious record collector, became a big fan of the Beatles, and sought to find a way to play the music that he enjoyed.
 </p>

<div class="p1">  
<p> When he was 18, he switched to guitar. “A friend of mine, a guitar player, showed me some chords and that was the start.” After his mandatory military service in Israel, he was introduced to jazz. “In the 1980s I took a class with a guy who went to Berklee and that is how I really started hearing jazz. The complexity of the music, its drive and the grooves are what attracted me to jazz and hooked me for life. I soaked up the lessons like there was no tomorrow.” Dedicating himself to performing creative jazz and finding his own musical path, Sarel played as much as possible in his homeland. In 1989 he made a major decision. “I had gained a lot of knowledge about jazz and got to the point where I knew that, if I really wanted to study and play this music, I had to go to the land of its birth. I packed my bags, went to the U.S., and studied at Berklee.”

 <div class="p1">  
<p> At the Berklee College Of Music where the great tenor-saxophonist Jerry Bergonzi became a mentor, Sarel learned a lot about harmonies and investigated different styles and approaches. He realized that jazz has its own vocabulary and that the most rewarding improvisations consist of musical sentences with a beginning, a middle and an end. Sarel had opportunities to play professionally before he graduated in 1994.
  </p>

 <div class="p1">  
<p> After leaving Berklee, Sarel moved to Budapest to join his wife who was attending medical school in Eastern Europe. The year that he spent in Hungary made a strong impression on him and he spent this period teaching, writing music and playing sessions.
  </p> 
 </div>
 
<div class="p1">  
  <p> Returning to the United States, Sarel soon settled in New York where he immediately began gigging in a wide variety of settings including playing at Small’s, gaining a strong reputation as a consistently creative guitarist who wrote picturesque and colorful originals.
